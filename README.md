# SPACEX API Stage 1 Landing Prediction
SpaceX promotes its Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, offering them at a cost of 62 million dollars. In comparison, other providers charge upwards of 165 million dollars for each launch. A significant factor contributing to SpaceX's cost savings is its ability to reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket. Consequently, determining the success of first-stage landings becomes crucial in estimating the launch cost. The Falcon 9 launch process is similar to that of regular rockets, consisting of three stages: Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3. Stage 2 and Stage 3 assist in propelling the payload into orbit, while Stage 1 primarily focuses on lifting the payload into space. The first stage is substantial and expensive.

Unlike many other rocket providers, SpaceX has developed the capability to recover and reuse the first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets. However, successful landings of the first stage do not always occur. In some cases, it may crash during the landing attempt, while in other cases, SpaceX may choose to sacrifice the first stage due to specific mission requirements such as payload, orbit, or customer preferences.

In this project, the aim is to gather information about SpaceX and create informative dashboards that can predict the price of each launch. Rather than solely relying on traditional rocket science principles to determine the success of first-stage landings, a machine learning model will be trained using publicly available data. This model will then assist in making predictions about the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage, based on the trained model and the relevant public information. The approach involves a combination of data analysis, visual representations, and machine learning techniques to estimate launch costs and evaluate the feasibility of first-stage reuse in SpaceX's operations.

# Project Bio:
The project aims to analyze and predict outcomes in a dataset obtained from an API related to rocket landings. The dataset contains information about various features associated with rocket landings, such as landing coordinates, booster versions, payload mass, landing sites, and landing outcomes. The goal is to utilize machine learning techniques to build models that can accurately predict the outcomes of rocket landings based on the provided features.

# Problem Statement:
The problem at hand is to analyze the provided dataset on rocket landings and develop a predictive model that can effectively determine the outcome of future rocket landings. By utilizing the available information, including various features related to each landing, the project aims to identify patterns and relationships that can be used to predict successful or unsuccessful rocket landings.

# Goals:
1. Data Preparation: Obtain the dataset on rocket landings from an API and convert it into a structured format suitable for analysis. Handle any missing or inconsistent data to ensure data integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of variables, identify any outliers, and understand the relationships between different features. Visualize the data using appropriate charts and graphs.

3. Feature Engineering: Enhance the dataset by creating new features or transforming existing ones. This may involve extracting relevant information from existing features, scaling or normalizing variables, or encoding categorical variables.

4. Model Building: Develop machine learning models using various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and random forests. Train the models on the labeled data to learn patterns and relationships between features and landing outcomes.

5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, R2 score, mean absolute error, and mean squared error. Utilize cross-validation techniques to assess the models' generalization capabilities and identify any overfitting or underfitting issues.

6. Predictive Analysis: Utilize the best-performing model to make predictions on new, unseen data. Assess the model's accuracy and reliability in predicting the outcomes of rocket landings.

By accomplishing these goals, the project aims to provide insights into the factors that contribute to successful or unsuccessful rocket landings and develop a predictive model that can assist in making informed decisions regarding future rocket landings.
